A lock allows only one thread to enter the part that's locked and the lock is not shared with any other processes.

A mutex is the same as a lock but it can be system wide.

A semaphore does the same as a mutex but allows x number of threads to enter.

You also have read/write locks that allows either unlimited number of readers or 1 writer at any given time.
