VERY IMPORTANT CONCEPT ABOUT SYNCHRONIZATION:

1) Consider two objects on a class. Both the objects belong to the SAME INSTANCE of the class.
i.e. Animal a1=new Animal();
     Animal a2=a1;
     
     Both objects a1 and a2 belong to the same instance of the Animal class.
2) The class Animal contains 4 non-static synchronized methods, 4 static synchronized methods and 4 non-synchronized methods.
3) If two threads are created such that Thread1 has object a1
   and Thread2 has object a2.
4) Then if Thread1 starts before Thread2. Then Thread1 will acquire locks for all the synchronized methods,
   hence Thread2 cannot enter in any of the synchronized methods of the class, even if Thread 1 wants to 
   execute in only 2 synchronized methods, but not all synchronized methods, but still all synchronized methods
   will be locked by object a1 which belongs to Thread1. But Thread2 can enter in non-synchronized methods of the class.
   Thread2 cannot enter in any of the synchronized methods of the class.
5) But if a1 and a2 are different instances of the class Animal such that:
   Animal a1=new Animal();
   Animal a2=new Animal();
       Thus, a1 and a2 are different instances of Animal class.
       In this case, if Thread1 which has object a1 enters in one of the non-static synchronized methods of the
       class, then the Thread2 which has object a2 can enter in other non-static synchronized methods of the class.
       But, if Thread1 enters in static synchronized method of the class, then any of the other static synchronized
       methods of the class can not be accessed by Thread2 even if object1 and object2 are different instance of
       the same class or same instances of the same class.
       This is because, even if a1 and a2 are different instances, but the STATIC keyword acquires lock at the
       class level. Hence no other instances of the object can be allowed in STATIC SYNCHRONIZED methods.
       
Please remember every part of the above explanation. Each and every word in the above explanation is 
VERY VERY IMPORTANT.
