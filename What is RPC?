Question : What is RPC ?

Source: http://searchsoa.techtarget.com/definition/Remote-Procedure-Call

Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a protocol that one program can use to request
a service from a program located in another computer in a network without having
to understand network details. (A procedure call is also sometimes known as a function call
or a subroutine call.) RPC uses the client/server model. The requesting program is a client 
and the service-providing program is the server. Like a regular or local procedure call,
an RPC is a synchronousoperation requiring the requesting program to be suspended until
the results of the remote procedure are returned. However, the use of lightweight processes 
or threads that share the same address space allows multiple RPCs to be performed concurrently.
