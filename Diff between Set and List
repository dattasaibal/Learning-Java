List vs Set in Java

Difference between Set and List in Javahere are few note worthy differences between List and Set in Java.
Remember that both of them are used to store objects and provides convenient API to insert, remove and
retrieve elements, along with to support Iteration over collection.

1) Fundamental difference between List and Set in Java is allowing duplicate elements. List in Java allows
duplicates while Set doesn't allow any duplicate. If you insert duplicate in Set it will replace the older
value. While if a duplicate is inserted in a List, it will be appended as the next element in the List.
In case of duplicates in Map, if the keys are the same, the value of the latest will overwrite the value
previously existed at that same key. (Remember, Map works on KEY-VALUE pairs)

2) Another significant difference between List and Set in Java is order. List is an Ordered Collection while
Set is an unordered Collection. List maintains insertion order of elements, means any element which is 
inserted before will go on lower index than any element which is inserted after. Set in Java doesn't  
maintain any order. Though Set provide another alternative called SortedSet which can store Set elements 
in specific Sorting order defined by Comparable and Comparator methods of Objects stored in Set.

3) Set uses equals() method to check uniqueness of elements stored in Set, while SortedSet uses compareTo()
method to implement natural sorting order of elements. In order for an element to behave properly in Set and
SortedSet, equals and compareTo must be consistent to each other.

4) Popular implementation of List interface in Java includes ArrayList, Vector and LinkedList. While popular
implementation of Set interface includes HashSet, TreeSet and LinkedHashSet.
