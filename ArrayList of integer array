Question: How to create an ArrayList of integer array
Source: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13665188/arraylist-of-integer-arrays-in-java

Ans. 
List<int[]> list = new ArrayList<int[]>();
                    OR
ArrayList<int[]> list = new ArrayList<int[]>();

First of all, several of the other answers are misleading and/or incorrect.
Note that an array is an object. So you can use them as elements in a list, no matter
whether the arrays themselves contain primitive types or object references.

Next, declaring a variable as List<int[]> list is preferred over declaring it as ArrayList<int[]>.
This allows you to easily change the List to a LinkedList or some other implementation without breaking 
the rest of your code because it is guaranteed to use only methods available in the List interface.
For more information, you should research "programming to the interface."
