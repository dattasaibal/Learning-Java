Question: GOLDEN QUESTIONS to be asked for every program that you type
Ans.
TR: SEBI SAUCY check
(SEBI SOSI)

This kind of checking is called SEBI-SOSI check, which is mandatory for every program.

SEBI SOSI check:
S -> Sample Input
E -> Extreme Cases
B -> Bugs
I -> Iterative or Recursive

S -> Streamlined
O -> Optimal
S -> Space and Time Complexity
I -> Improve Space and Time Complexity

Questions to be asked for each program:
1. Did you test the code for SAMPLE inputs ? If no, then test it for sample inputs.
2. Did you handle EXTREME cases when the input is null, or 1, or 2 ? No, then handle the extreme cases.
3. Does the program have BUGS ? If yes, then remove the bugs.
4. Is the solution ITERATIVE or recursive ? If recursive, then implement iterative solution if it exists.
5. Is the solution STREAMLINED ? Are all import statement included. If not streamlined then make it streamlined
6. Is the solution OPTIMAL ? If no, then make it optimal
7. What is the SPACE and time complexity ?
8. Can you IMPROVE the space and time complexity ? If yes, then improve the space and time complexity

FOLLOW EVEYTHING MENTIONED ABOVE RELIGIOUSLY FOR EVERY PROGRAM THAT YOU TYPE.
