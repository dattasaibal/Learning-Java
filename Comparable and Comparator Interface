Comparable (compareTo(Object o) method) and Comparator(compare(Object o1, Object o2) and equals(Object o)), 
both are interfaces in Java.
Comparator -> To Remember: eater.Hence the method name is compare(Object o1, Object o2)
But for balance it has the second method as well which is equals(Object o)
Comparable -> To Remember: keep the thing. Hence the method is compareTo(Object o). But this is the only method
that it has.


Comparator belongs to util package
Comparable belongs to lang package

Comparator is used for user-defined ordering
Comparable is used for natural ordering

Both are interfaces and support generics:
Interface Comparator<T>
Interface Comparable<T>

Also before going to the video tutorials, please read the java docs for Comparator and Comparable.
