Comparable (compareTo(Object o) method) and Comparator(compare(Object o1, Object o2) and equals(Object o)), 
both are interfaces in Java.
Comparator -> To Remember: eater. Hence only one method.
Comparable -> To Remember: keep the thing. Hence two methods.

Also before going to the video tutorials, please read the java docs for Comparator and Comparable.
