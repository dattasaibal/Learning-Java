Please consider the below piece of code:

HashSet hs = new HashSet();
hs.add("hi"); -- (1)
hs.add("hi"); -- (2)
hs.size() will give 1 

I want to know if we add the duplicate element, then does it replace the previous element or it simply doesn't add it?

Also, what will happen usingHashMap for the same case?


Answer -> 

Now in HashMap, it replaces the old value with the new one.

Also in the case of HashSet, the old is replaced with the new one.


Both of them dont allow duplicates, the old is replaced with the new value.


Only in case of LinkedList, duplicates are allowed.

Between LL, HashMap and HashSet -> LL is the data structure which allows duplicates. The rest two dont allow 
duplicates.
